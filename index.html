You should ideally use as little escaping as possible and use UTF-8 to express characters natively. To do this you need an editor that can handle UTF-8 as well as a correct charset declaration

    My second rule is to set the font family for pre elements, as some browsers forget to use a fixed pitch font when you set the font size or other properties for pre.

    A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.

    The best proven way to pick up new knowledge (or as far as I can tell) for me has always been the same; go head-first dive into the topic until I can knock some sense out of the paper, and soak in it to the degree that makes me well-informed enough (though it's never enough) to retell it to anyone struggling to get the gist of the concept, and most importantly to my forgetful, ignorant, and silly old future self who may need it the most.

    This is where any writable medium can come in hand. I‚Äôve always kept myself with the stack of draft paper wherever I go (old-fashioned, but highly sophisticated innit?) written in the most casual and stripped down way possible (poor myself‚Äôs brain can only comprehend CS topics explained in baby language). To writer‚Äôs grief, most of them serve no purpose at all when come back later, as oftentimes they get lost completely due time, or are scribbled in a manner way too indistinct and unintelligible to decipher.

    Praying this migration to the digital medium will help me get by all the troubles I‚Äôve had in the past, I as well hope my materials can help saving some troubles for the fellow programmers out there. And always remember to take these with the grain of salt. Here's the one for my very first published writing. üçª Sk√•l!
